This is development stage, also called prototyping. However, when we finished creating some functionality, we don't want anymore to fiddle with the environment, change some parameters in the code manually, select line to run, etc. We want clarity, predictability and replicability from our code, because that is the cornerstone of good coding practices (incidentally, it is also the cornerstone of good science practices). For that reason we create scripts.\n",
