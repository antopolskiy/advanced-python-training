    "# PEP8 and style guidelines\n",
    "- Python is an open-source language with core developers and a community proposing and discussing features\n",
    "- Every decision in the language development is signified with a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) which includes the feature analysis, reasons, implementation details, sometimes also discussions. All PEPs can be viewed here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/. This is not the documentation, but more like \"developer notes\". There is usually no reason for a user to read PEPs, except for curiosity, but it is a good example of how a long term successful open-source project is structured.\n",
    "- One exception to the rule is PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. It defines the style guidelines for writing Python code, and it is worth reading. Another is PEP20: The Zen of Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)\n",
    "- We need PEP8 to make code more standardized and more easily readable. It is not the \"absolute best\" guideline, but it is one that Python users have chosen to follow.\n",
    "- Try to follow PEP8 always in the beginning. Later, when you know it well, you will see if and where you can ignore it."
