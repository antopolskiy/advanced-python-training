    "You have all installed on your computers a distribution of Python called Anaconda, produced by Continuum Analytics. They have solved a very important problem for Python programmers, which is a problem of package and Python version management. Although now it is less true, for a long time several versions of Python were used in parallel, Python 2.7 and Python 3.x (as of 2018 it is 3.6). And some packages supported only Python 2.7 (which is an older verison) and others -- only Python 3.x. Most packages support both versions, although version for Python 2.7 is usually only updated to fix critical bugs. Indeed, Python project itself plans to end supporting version 2.7 in a few years, so people are actively migrating to Python 3. For us, the difference between the versions are minor, with Python 3 having much more functionality and improvements. Basically the only reason not to migrate to Python 3 is the inertia of large scale projects, which need a lot of time investiment in order to migrate without breaking anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, with different version of Python and packages, it was very difficult to troubleshoot any problems. For example you discover that a new version of some package is buggy in 1 function, for one of your application, but otherwise it is much better. Changing the version every time you run that one application is cumbersome. So what do you do? *(This is of course a very simplistic problem, in reality package management is a huge issue for professional developers, but usually not for data scientists).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is -- you create virtual environments which are completely separated from each other, and you can switch from one to another. You can have different versions of packages in different environments, or, in fact, even different versions of Python. **`conda`** is a way to control these environments, and this is what we will learn in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "*All of this notebook is to be done in the console. I will run some commands from the notebook using IPython magic, but many commands cannot be run like this, and I will only type them out here. You should run everything in the console (without *`!`* in the beginning).*"
